title: "About Daily Agile"
---

Daily Agile is a contemplative journey exploring Agile wisdom through diverse perspectives.

In the ever-evolving landscape of work, the Agile philosophy has emerged as a beacon of hope, guiding teams towards a more collaborative, adaptive, and human-centric approach. Inspired by the profound wisdom found in Ryan Holiday's "The Daily Stoic," the idea for Daily Agile was born – a platform dedicated to fostering deeper contemplation and understanding of Agile principles and practices.

The Daily Stoic's powerful blend of ancient wisdom and modern-day relevance struck a chord, prompting the realisation that a similar approach could be invaluable for Agile practitioners. By curating a collection of thought-provoking quotes from both Agile luminaries and historical figures, Daily Agile aims to ignite introspection and spark meaningful discussions within the Agile community.

At its core, Daily Agile recognises that Agile is not merely a set of rigid rules or methodologies, but a mindset – a way of thinking and being that transcends any specific framework. By exploring diverse perspectives and drawing from a tapestry of wisdom, Daily Agile invites its readers to embark on a journey of self-discovery, challenging them to question their assumptions and explore what it truly means to embrace an Agile way of life.
