title: "My Journey"

My journey into Agile began not with a certification, but with a frustration with the status quo. I saw projects failing, teams burning out, and customers unhappy. I knew there had to be a better way.

Discovering the Agile Manifesto was a watershed moment. It wasn't just a new process; it was a philosophy that aligned with my values.

Since then, I've been on a continuous path of learning, unlearning, and relearning. From the trenches of software development to the boardrooms of large enterprises, I've seen the transformative power of Agile when applied with authenticity and care.
