title: "Why I Write"
---

Writing is a tool for thinking. By articulating thoughts on Agile, leadership, and team dynamics, I clarify my own understanding and hope to spark similar clarity for others.

I write to:
- Share knowledge and experiences
- Challenge conventional wisdom
- Connect with like-minded practitioners
- Document my own learning journey

Every post is an invitation to dialogue.
