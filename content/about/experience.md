title: "My Experience"
---

I have spent over a decade working with teams across various industries, helping them embrace Agile principles and practices.

## Key Highlights

- **Scrum Master & Agile Coach:** Guided multiple teams through their Agile transformations.
- **Workshop Facilitator:** Designed and led interactive workshops on Scrum, Kanban, and Agile leadership.
- **Speaker:** Presented at regional and international Agile conferences.

My experience has taught me that while frameworks are useful, it is the *people* and their interactions that truly determine success.
