My primary goal with Daily Agile is to create a resource that I wish I had when I started my journey.

## Specific Goals:

1.  **Inspire Reflection:** To provide daily prompts that encourage deeper thinking about our work.
2.  **Foster Community:** To build a space where practitioners can share insights and support one another.
3.  **Humanize Work:** To advocate for workplaces that respect and empower individuals.
4.  **Simplify Complexity:** To break down complex Agile concepts into actionable insights.
