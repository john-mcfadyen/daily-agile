True leadership in an Agile context isn't about command and control; it's about service and empowerment. It requires the courage to step back and let the team shine, while providing the safety and support they need to experiment, fail, and learn. Modern leaders must navigate the delicate balance between providing direction and encouraging autonomy.

## The Servant Leader's Mindset

Servant leadership is often misunderstood as "soft" or passive. In reality, it is a demanding and active form of leadership that prioritizes the growth and well-being of team members and the communities to which they belong.

Key attributes of an Agile leader include:
- **Listening:** A deep commitment to listening intently to others.
- **Empathy:** The ability to understand and share the feelings of others.
- **Awareness:** General awareness, and especially self-awareness.
- **Persuasion:** Relying on persuasion rather than positional authority.

## Challenges in Transitioning

Transitioning from a traditional management style to Agile leadership is rarely easy. It challenges deeply held beliefs about power, control, and success. However, the rewards—more engaged teams, higher quality products, and a more adaptive organisation—are well worth the effort.
