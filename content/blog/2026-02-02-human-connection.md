> "The measure of intelligence is the ability to change." — Albert Einstein


This quote by Albert Einstein perfectly encapsulates our focus this month. In the world of Agile, we often get caught up in the mechanics—the stand-ups, the boards, the velocities—and we forget the underlying philosophy that makes these tools work. My approach has always been that Agile isn't something you do; it's a way you perceive the flow of value and the human connections that sustain it. 

When we look at agile is about people, we see a microcosm of this principle. It's about stripping away the ego of the 'perfect plan' and replacing it with the humility of the 'helpful experiment'. In my experience, the teams that truly excel are the ones that stop trying to be 'right' and start trying to be 'useful'. They weave this mindset into every conversation, every line of code, and every interaction with the user. This isn't just theory; it's the survival mechanism of modern delivery. By embracing this reflection, we align ourselves with the true spirit of agility—constant, purposeful evolution.
